## 1 - Eavesdropping 101
* **Project Area :** Cryptography
* **Mentors :** Ravija Chandel,Rahul Jha(juggernaut.jha#1241)
* **Description :** Most projects on cryptography focus on algorithms but like the great Loup Vailant said, one should never roll their own crypto. We will start with basics of finite fields before diving headfirst into DES and AES. Less time would be spent on the specifics of implementation and more time on the cryptanalysis. Then we will introduce key exchange, and their weaknesses.
  Prerequisites: MTH102 (Linear Algebra), ESC101 (Intro To CS)

* **Intended Audience :** Y21-Y22

* **Expected Duration :** 10 weeks 

* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** 6 hours 


## 2 - Some Problems in Combinatorics 
* **Mentors :** Farzan Byramji (geekotechy#7312), Pranshu Gaur (pran#1011)  

* **Project Area :** Combinatorics

* **Description :** The main goal will be to try solving some problems in combinatorics that seem interesting. Problems of several kinds like enumerative, algebraic, or extremal can be considered. Some of these may have connections to TCS or discrete probability.

     * **Prerequisites :** Some very basic combinatorics (say roughly at the level of Bona's A Walk through Combinatorics or the course CS201) is desirable. More knowledge related to the kind of problems one is interested in tackling (for instance, from Stanley's books for enumerative combinatorics or Alon and Spencer's The Probabilistic Method for some extremal stuff) would be helpful. None of this is strictly necessary (or sufficient) and most things can be picked up as we go along. Some mathematical maturity is perhaps the only essential requirement.

* **Intended Audience :** Open to all

* **Expected Duration :** 2-3 months 

* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** 3-6 hours

* **Project Area :** Time Series Analysis, Stationary Processes, Machine Learning 


* **Description :** This project will cover in detail the concept of Time Series Analysis, which is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. Time series analysis helps us understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Using data visualizations, we can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur.
Some of the topics we plan to cover :
Time Series Data: Firstly, we'll look at the types of data and study how to make visualizations of those data, and how do we deal with missing values in our dataset. We also study how to find outliers in the data through some statistical methods.
Characteristics and Components: Next, we'll study the characteristics of time series (smoothening, decomposition, correlation) and also study about the components of time series (trends, seasonality, cyclic variations, residuals)
Time Series Models: Next up, we'll study each time series model in detail and implement them in python using statsmodel library. We will study basic models such as white noise and random walk, and move to more complex models such as AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMAX and then study models that predict volatility such as ARCH, GARCH models.
Space State Models: In the end, we’ll spend a week studying about State Space Models, particularly MSTL Decomposition, and make forecasting using Unobserved Components Models (UCM)
